# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

## 2. Reflection on Reading Assignments
While reading the "Open Source Defintion", I noticed that it specifically outlined that not only does code have to be public and free it also has to be written in a manner that is not "deliberately obfuscated". I also noticed that it had reshare licensing so by using the code you are limited in how you can then distribute your project. I found this particularly interesting. 

"How To Ask A Question" laid out a lot of great resources for fixing things before asking for help. I particularly liked it's breakdown of where to post questions.

Another suggestion is when answering he stated that you shouldn't be authoratative on things you don't know, but sometimes it helps to say Have you tried x because according to x resource it should ...

In reading chapter three of Free Culture, I was absolutely confused and angry on behalf of my fellow rpi student. I still don't understand what law he broke. It also is insane because it seems to me that the law can't decide who is responsible for content on the internet. Like how is what he did different from youtube allowing searches on videos the posters didn't have the right to post. I feel like if the "administrator" of the search engine is responsible for what can be searched big tech companies should be sued way more often. What i got out of this chapter is that corporate america is unfair, you should be really careful when coding and online ownership laws are super confusing. I think the takeaway was also just how careful you should be when working on projects because there can be so many unintended consequensces. My question though is also how it became known that he made this fix. He was working on an intranet which should have been a sort of sandbox environment.

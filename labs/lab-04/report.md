It is important to choose a license because it allows others to work on the code and use it in defined ways. If you do not choose a license, every contributor has copyright over their own code. Therefore you using it, even if it is your own project, could become problematic. It also allows you to decide how you want others to interact with your own work, and how they can change and commercialize it.
  
4.  
If you use a project without an explicit license, you are using someone's copyrighted code. It is not implied that because you can use the project that you are legally allowed to use it. It also makes it very unclear as to how you would be allowed to modify and distribute the project.
  
5.  
The author of this article argues that Gophers failed for a variety of reasons. However, I agree with the author's point that community is a big factor towards the success of the technology. The main advantage the world wide web had was the community that used it, documented it and built new features. I feel like social inertia plays a big part in what OSS projects succeed and which don't.

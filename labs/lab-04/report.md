It is important to choose a license because it allows others to work on the code and use it in defined ways. If you do not choose a license, every contributor has copyright over their own code. Therefore you using it, even if it is your own project, could become problematic. It also allows you to decide how you want others to interact with your own work, and how they can change and commercialize it.

If you use a project without an explicit license, you are using someone's copyrighted code. It is not implied that because you can use the project that you are legally allowed to use it. It also makes it very unclear as to how you would be allowed to modify and distribute the project.

The author of this article argues that Gophers failed for a variety of reasons. However, I agree with the author's point that community is a big factor towards the success of the technology. The main advantage the world wide web had was the community that used it, documented it and built new features. I feel like social inertia plays a big part in what projects and technologies succeed and which don't. I mean when I am picking technologies, I generally go for whichever has the most documentation and community support not necessarily which is the best for the solution because if I can't understand how to use it then it doesn't really do me any good anyway.

I think one of the major reasons the linux kernel uses a GPL v2 license is because it is based on the Linux operating system which also uses a GPL v2 license. The GPL v2 license is a [copyleft license](https://fossa.com/blog/all-about-copyleft-licenses/) which means that it requires derivatives to also be GPL v2. In choosing the Apache 2.0 license for Android, Google is  allowed to use it in their [proprietary software](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-licenses-101-apache-license-2-0/#:~:text=The%20Apache%20License%202.0%20outlines,they%20then%20sell%20to%20customers) and make money off of it. Linux was built with the intent of developing a more accessible operating system and Linus himself has said "I think everybody involved ends up being much happier when they know that everybody has equal rights, and nobody is special with regards to licensing. [newsstack](https://thenewstack.io/linus-torvalds-on-why-open-source-solves-the-biggest-problems/)" GPL v2 has allowed everyone who uses or contributes to Linux to be protected with the same rights and also protects future iterations by being copy left. For example Android couldn't make their kernel code proprietary and thus futher propagated the free, accesible OS that Linux hoped to create. However, after being acquired by Google (and maybe even before), Android was created as a way to earn money. So while the base OS might have been open source, all of the google specific apps on top of it don't have to be and aren't. This allows google to control use of it's technology by omitting key parts of the functionality in the free version. Apache 2.0 allows a company to use the code commercially in proprietary software. Google licenses their version of Android to other companies for a profit. Notably, in 2019, [Google pulled Huawei's commercial license](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension) to use its proprietary version of Android. This forces Huawei to use the OSS version which lacks key functionality that users will notice.
